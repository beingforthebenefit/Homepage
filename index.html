                Welcome to the home page of Gerald Todd. This website was built using a plain text editor, no external libraries or frameworks (with the exceptions of the linked projects), no inline CSS, and is totally <a class="body-section__link" href="http://getbem.com/" target="_blank">BEMed out</a>. It is desktop and mobile friendly. The site is also self-hosted on my local server. I admire simplicity, and I tried to reflect this in the design. I am color-blind, so forgive me if <a class="body-section__link" href="https://www.coolors.co" target="_blank">coolors.co</a> generated an ugly color palette.

            <p class="body-section__paragraph">Dependencies worry me. A lot. Just ask <a class="body-section__link" href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets" target="_blank">these two million developers</a>. I do everything in my power to write in vanilla Javascript/PHP/etc. for it helps me more deeply understand these languages, creates a smaller and more secure application, and is just cool. When I have to work with libraries and frameworks, a deeper understanding of the base code gives me a benefit.

                My career goals have always been in the areas of math, science, technology, and education.  After getting a few degrees in Mathematics, I began working as a full-stack (LEMP) developer for a small company in Portland, OR. Programming is a requisite skill for advanced mathematics and is something I've become proficient with. I keep my skills sharp in my personal life by building my own computer, maintaining my own media server, and using SoCs to run my own DNS server and power a homemade wall-mounted infoboard (News, calendar, schedule, pretty pictures, etc.).

                From when I first started building simple static webpages in HTML when I was 13, I have always had an obsessive curiosity with how technology works.

            <p class="body-section__paragraph">
                I have steadily taught mathematics as a tutor since 2005, and taught courses
                at the university level since 2014. I earned my Master's degree in applied
                math, optimization, combinatorics and analysis. Education is a passion
                of mine as I have taken many graduate courses on the subject and taught
                university math courses since 2014. I have also won awards for being the top
                graduate student teacher. Through teaching and tutoring for the past 10
                years, I have gained excellent skills working with other people and making
                firm (sometimes unpopular) decisions all while keeping a positive rapport.
                My leadership skills have been honed over the years through teaching at the
                University of Montana. In the group of teachers that had courses alongside
                mine, I was the only native English speaker. This meant that I was in charge
                of coordinating the courses. These responsibilities included:
            </p>
            <ul class="body-section__ulist">
                <li>organizing semiweekly meetings with all course instructors</li>
                <li>laying out a plan for the structure of the courses</li>
                <li>adapting that structure based on live feedback from the other instructors</li>
                <li>organizing out-of-class events for students to provide extra help for those in need</li>
                <li>maintaining the webpage</li>
                <li>constructing the homework assignments for the courses</li>
                <li>writing the exams for the courses</li>
                <li>devising a grading rubric for the courses</li>
                <li>proofreading all content by the various instructors</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body-section__paragraph">
                I excelled at all aspects of this job and even won an award for having the highest student evaluation of all graduate student teachers.
